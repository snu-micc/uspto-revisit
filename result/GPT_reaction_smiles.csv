For example, since adipic acid melts at 170° C. but the aromatic dicarboxylic acid generally remains solid without dissolved in the molten straight-chain α,ω-aliphatic dicarboxylic acid at this temperature, a mixture thereof is in a suspension phase. If a large amount of m-xylylenediamine is added dropwise into a mixture in the suspension phase, the added m-xylylenediamine reacts with the molten adipic acid in preference to the solid aromatic dicarboxylic acid. Therefore, the reaction between m-xylylenediamine with the aromatic dicarboxylic acid does not proceed sufficiently. In addition, the m-xylylenediamine/aromatic dicarboxylic acid repeating units are not randomly introduced in the backbone, but the m-xylylenediamine/adipic acid repeating units and the m-xylylenediamine/aromatic dicarboxylic acid repeating units respectively form distinct blocks, thereby likely to result in the failure of reducing the melting point of polyamide as well as likely to make the mechanical and chemical properties unstable.","{

The solid is added to 150 ml of acetic acid and cooled to 20° C. A slurry of 12 g N-chlorosuccinimide in 75 ml acetic acid is added portionwise with cooling to maintain a reaction temperature of 20°-25° C. The reaction mixture is stirred for three hours at room temperature and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give an oil which is dissolved in methylene chloride and washed with water. The organic phase is dried, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give an oil which is dissolved in 250 ml ether and cooled to 10° C.

After stirring under argon until all solids had dissolved the reaction vessel was purged several times with carbon monoxide and placed under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide (balloon). The mixture was then heated to 100° C. and stirred overnight. Further portions of palladium acetate (0.50 mmol) and 1,3-bis-(diphenylphosphino)propane (0.50 mmol) were added and the mixture stirred at 100° C. for a further 6 h. After cooling water (200 ml) was added and the aqueous solution was extracted with three 75 ml portions of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were dried (Na2SO4) and solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting brown oil was purified by column chromatography eluting with ethyl acetate.

(1956) 78:5662) with acetanhydride and pyridine. (a) A solution of this acetate (4.8 g, 15.17 mmol) in toluene (10 ml) was pyrolyzed (b) at 540° (200 Torr, slow N2-stream) in a glass tube packed with quartz pieces. Chromatography of the crude pyrolysate (3.1 g) on silica gel (150 g) with CH2Cl2 gave 1.1 g (28%) of the homogenous oily ketone 9; +57.9° (C 1) ((27]: m.p. 71-73°). -IR.

192,['many_reactant (> 2)'],"2-butene-1,4-dibutyrate","To a 200 gallon reactor equipped with an efficient cooling system was charged methyl tert-butyl ether (MtBE, 278 L), DMAP (391 g, 3.2 moles), triethylamine (102.3 L, 74.4 kg, 736.2 moles) and 2-butene-1,4-diol (26.4 L, 28.2 kg, 320 moles). The stirrer was started and the temperature of the reaction mixture was cooled to approximately 4° C. Butyryl chloride (69.6 L, 71.5 kg, 672 moles) was added to the reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain the batch temperature below 20° C. The triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates during the addition and the reaction mixture becomes a thick, but movable slurry. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture (silica gel plate; Analtech No. 02521, eluted with 9:1 hexane/EtOAc, and visualized with PMA stain) indicated the reaction was complete after stirring for an additional hour after the addition was complete. Water (120 L) was added to the reactor, and the resulting mixture was stirred until all of the solids dissolved. The phases were separated. The lower (aqueous) layer was checked by TLC analysis for the absence of product (if product is present, save the layer for future product recovery). The upper, organic layer was washed with water (72 L), saturated aqueous potassium bicarbonate (72 L, checked to make sure the exiting aqueous layer was basic, evaporated, under reduced pressure, to afford 69.4 kg of 2-butene-1,4-dibutyrate (95% yield) as a pale golden oil.

After separation, the combined organic phases were dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered. and evaporated to give only 0.1 g of a white solid. The aqueous phase was therefore lyophilized and the residue extracted with hot methanol. The residue, consisting of inorganic salts, was discarded while the methanol extracts were combined and evaporated at reduced pressure to give the title compound (1.34 g, 75%).","{

The cooled reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated to leave an orange residue which was dissolved in 50 ml of THF. 35 ml of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate were added, and the mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 18 hours and then diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were dried with MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to leave a white solid which was chromatographed over silica gel using the solvent system of ethyl acetate:hexane (1:3) as the eluant. The fractions containing the desired product were combined and concentrated to leave a white solid. Recrystallization of the solid from toluene/hexane gave 4.88 g of the desired ester as white needles, mp=156°-157.5° C.; tlc, Rf =0.2, silica gel, ethyl acetate:hexane (1:3).","{

Subsequently, 4-({4-[η6-(2-chloro-phenyl)-η5-cyclopentadienyliron(II)]piperazin-1-yl}carbonyloxymethyl)phenoxymethyl polystyrene hexafluorophosphate (3.5 g, 2.45 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 55° C. for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was filtered off and washed with tetrahydrofuran (2×50 mL), tetrahydrofuran/water (1:1) (2×50 mL), N,N-dimethylformamide (2×50 mL), water (2×50 mL), methanol (3×50 mL), tetrahydrofuran (3×50 mL), and subsequently with methanol and tetrahydrofuran (each 50 mL, 5 cycles). Finally, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3×50 mL) and dried in vacuo (25° C., 12 h) to yield a dark orange resin. The thus obtained resin and a 0.5 M solution of 1,10-phenanthroline in 3:1 mixture of pyridine/water (20 mL) was placed in light-transparent reactor tube. The suspension was agitated by rotation under irradiation with visible light for 12 h. The resin was filtered and washed with methanol (2×25 mL), water (2×25 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (3×25 mL) until the washing solutions were colourless (approx. 5 cycles) and the irradiation procedure was repeated until decomplexation was complete (approx. 5 cycles). After the decomplexation was completed, the resin was washed with dichlormethane (3×25 mL) and dried in vacuo (25° C., 12 h) to obtain a light brown resin. 100 mg (77 μmol) of the thus obtained resin were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and dichlormethane (2 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 h.

The said process involves column chromatography purification in each stage and the amidation reaction take place without usage of solvent. When the present inventors were working on the same reaction, it was surprisingly found that the n-butyl amine reaction with protected dihydroxy compound i.e., tert-butyl 2-((4R,6S)-6-(hydroxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-yl)acetate in presence of methanol solvent provides the compound with high purity and yield.

One such process is illustrated in drugs of the future, 24 (8), 862-870 (1999), represented as scheme-1. In which 3-isobutylglutaric acid, compound 2, is converted into the corresponding anhydride, compound 3, by treatment with refluxing acetic anhydride. The reaction of the anhydride with NH4OH produces the glutaric acid mono-amide, compound 4, which is resolved with (R)-1-phenylethylamine, yielding the (R)-phenyl ethylamine salt of (R)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid, compound 5. Combining the salt with an acid liberates the (R)-enantiomer, compound 6. Finally, a Hoffmann's degradation with Br2/NaOH provides (S)-Pregabalin. A disadvantage of this method is that, it requires separating the two enantiomer thereby resulting in the loss of half of the product, such that the process cost is high.","{
