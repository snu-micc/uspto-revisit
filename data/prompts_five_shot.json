{"final_prompt": "Examine the heading and related paragraph from US patent data detailing a chemical reaction. Your goal is to extract key reaction information in JSON format, identifying relevant reactants, solvents, catalysts, and products using their IUPAC names. Think step by step and before you return the final answer, evaluate whether it is a reasonable answer. If it is not a reasonable answer, repeat the extraction. \n    \nAssign each chemical entity a unique uppercase code(sequential alphabet), containing only the IUPAC name without unrelated phrases or modifiers. Detail the reaction steps, differentiating between the reaction itself and the work-up process, and clearly specify each action with below listed verb. The work-up process falls into two categories: 'Work-up' for steps aimed at isolation and purification which do not modify the reaction's chemistry and 'Work-up-involve' for steps directly tied to completing the reaction. Remove equipment and atmosphere elements not related to the reaction, such as nitrogen gas, argon gas, and chromatography columns (alumina, silica-gel, etc.).\n\n  This is the verb list for each category:\n  [Reaction]: [Add, Mix, Heat, Formation]\n  [Work-up-involve]: [Quench, pH adjust, Cool, Dissolve]\n  [Work-up]: [Purify, Evaporate, Separate, Extract, Crystallize, Wash, Precipitate, Purge, Concentrate, Dry, Remove, Chromatography, Distillate, Dilute]\n\nUse only the verbs listed above for 'Action', ensuring each corresponds to its respective category. Also, label all unspecified outcomes sequentially as 'mixture1', 'mixture2', 'mixture3', etc.\n\nYour output should follow below JSON format:{\"Reactants, Solvents, Catalysts\": {\"Code\": \"name\"}, \"Product\": {\"Code\": \"name\"}, \"Reaction Steps\": {\"Number (Reaction/Work-up/Work-up-involve, Action)\": \"Reactant(s)+Solvent(s)+Catalyst(s)->mixture\"}}\n\nThis is the five examples of the input and output.\n[input]\n**title**2-[-2-(4-methyl-5-imidazolylmethylthio)ethylamino]-5-benzyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidone\n **paragraph**5-Benzyl-6-methylthiouracil (6.0 gms) and sodium hydroxide (1.06 gms) were dissolved in water (30 mls).

The resulting cloudy mixture is extracted twice with 30 ml. portions of ethyl acetate. After being dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate, the combined extracts are filtered and the solvent is evaporated in vacuo.
