['many_product (> 1)'],m-xylylenediamine adipic acid,"Generally, the melting point of aromatic dicarboxylic acid is higher than that of straight-chain α,ω-aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. Therefore, there is a temperature range in which a mixture of dicarboxylic acids is in a suspension phase comprising a molten straight-chain α,ω-aliphatic dicarboxylic acid and a solid aromatic dicarboxylic acid not dissolved in the molten straight-chain α,ω-aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. For example, since adipic acid melts at 170° C. but the aromatic dicarboxylic acid generally remains solid without dissolved in the molten straight-chain α,ω-aliphatic dicarboxylic acid at this temperature, a mixture thereof is in a suspension phase. If a large amount of m-xylylenediamine is added dropwise into a mixture in the suspension phase, the added m-xylylenediamine reacts with the molten adipic acid in preference to the solid aromatic dicarboxylic acid. Therefore, the reaction between m-xylylenediamine with the aromatic dicarboxylic acid does not proceed sufficiently. In addition, the m-xylylenediamine/aromatic dicarboxylic acid repeating units are not randomly introduced in the backbone, but the m-xylylenediamine/adipic acid repeating units and the m-xylylenediamine/aromatic dicarboxylic acid repeating units respectively form distinct blocks, thereby likely to result in the failure of reducing the melting point of polyamide as well as likely to make the mechanical and chemical properties unstable.","{

Then, 80 g of ethanol is added to this solution and subsequently 17.87 g (20 mmol) of a 26.0% aqueous solution of lanthanum chloride is added at a dropping rate of 1 ml/min, which are further reacted at the same temperature for 0 minute with stirring, whereby lanthanum di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate is gradually precipitated to cause white turbidity in the solution. The precipitates are dissolved by adding 80 g of cyclohexane to the solution with stirring. The reaction solution is left at rest to remove the separated water layer. After the washing with 25 ml of water three times, a reflux dehydrator is mounted onto the vessel to remove water and ethanol in the reaction solution through azeotropy with cyclohexane, and then the same procedure as in [Example 1] is conducted to obtain 53.8 g of a solution of lanthanum di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate in cyclohexane having a concentration of about 40%.

Phosphorous pentachloride is added to a chloroform solution containing the di-Cbz product to yield on workup D,L-4-(benzyloxycarbonylaminomethyl)-oxazolidin-2,5-dione. A solution of L-proline t-butyl ester in methylene chloride is added to the N-carboxyanhydride in tetrahydrofuran at -60° C. After overnight freezer storage, the mixture is stripped to dryness affording crude product. Trifluoroacetic acid effectively cleaves the t-butyl ester in 2 hours at room temperature resulting in a gross mixture of L-proline and β-benzyloxycarbonylamino-D,L-alanyl-L-proline. Gel filtration chromatography (LH-20) results in pure dipeptide. 2-Oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid and benzyloxycarbonylamino-D,L-alanyl-L-proline are condensed in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride. Removal of the protecting group from the resulting product yields N-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-β-amino-D,L-alanyl-L-proline. The nmr in D2O showed aromatic protons at 7.4δ, methine protons at 4.2δ and multiplets at 3.7, 3.2, 2.9 and 2.1δ.","{

The mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min after the generation of hydrogen had ceased. Subsequently, 4-({4-[η6-(2-chloro-phenyl)-η5-cyclopentadienyliron(II)]piperazin-1-yl}carbonyloxymethyl)phenoxymethyl polystyrene hexafluorophosphate (3.5 g, 2.45 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 55° C. for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was filtered off and washed with tetrahydrofuran (2×50 mL), tetrahydrofuran/water (1:1) (2×50 mL), N,N-dimethylformamide (2×50 mL), water (2×50 mL), methanol (3×50 mL), tetrahydrofuran (3×50 mL), and subsequently with methanol and tetrahydrofuran (each 50 mL, 5 cycles). Finally, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3×50 mL) and dried in vacuo (25° C., 12 h) to yield a dark orange resin. The thus obtained resin and a 0.5 M solution of 1,10-phenanthroline in 3:1 mixture of pyridine/water (20 mL) was placed in light-transparent reactor tube. The suspension was agitated by rotation under irradiation with visible light for 12 h. The resin was filtered and washed with methanol (2×25 mL), water (2×25 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (3×25 mL) until the washing solutions were colourless (approx. 5 cycles) and the irradiation procedure was repeated until decomplexation was complete (approx. 5 cycles). After the decomplexation was completed, the resin was washed with dichlormethane (3×25 mL) and dried in vacuo (25° C., 12 h) to obtain a light brown resin. 100 mg (77 μmol) of the thus obtained resin were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and dichlormethane (2 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The resin was filtered off and washed with methanol (1×0.5 mL) and dichloromethane (1×0.5 mL). The filtrates were collected and the volatile solvents evaporated in vacuo.

['rare_temp'],"(3R,5S)—N-butyl-3,5,6-trihydroxyhexanamide","As per the PCT publication number WO2008/044243, the N-butyl-2-((4R,6S)-6-formyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-yl)acetamide compound of formula-3a prepared by the reaction of (3R,5S)-tert-butyl 3,5,6-trihydroxy hexanoate with n-butylamine at 70-80° C. to provide the (3R,5S)—N-butyl-3,5,6-trihydroxyhexanamide, which on further reaction with 2,2-dimethoxy propane to provide N-butyl-2-((4R,6S)-6-(hydroxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-yl)acetamide followed by oxidation with oxalyl chloride provides the compound of formula-3a. The said process involves column chromatography purification in each stage and the amidation reaction take place without usage of solvent. When the present inventors were working on the same reaction, it was surprisingly found that the n-butyl amine reaction with protected dihydroxy compound i.e., tert-butyl 2-((4R,6S)-6-(hydroxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-yl)acetate in presence of methanol solvent provides the compound with high purity and yield. However, it was observed that when ethanol is used in place of methanol the said reaction was not proceeded further.","{

In which 3-isobutylglutaric acid, compound 2, is converted into the corresponding anhydride, compound 3, by treatment with refluxing acetic anhydride. The reaction of the anhydride with NH4OH produces the glutaric acid mono-amide, compound 4, which is resolved with (R)-1-phenylethylamine, yielding the (R)-phenyl ethylamine salt of (R)-3-(carbamoylmethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid, compound 5. Combining the salt with an acid liberates the (R)-enantiomer, compound 6. Finally, a Hoffmann's degradation with Br2/NaOH provides (S)-Pregabalin. A disadvantage of this method is that, it requires separating the two enantiomer thereby resulting in the loss of half of the product, such that the process cost is high.","{
